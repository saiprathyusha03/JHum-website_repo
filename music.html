                <p>Nice to meet you, where you been?<br>
                    I could show you incredible things<br>
                    Magic, madness, heaven, sin<br>
                    Saw you there and I thought<br>
                    "Oh, my God, look at that face<br>
                    You look like my next mistake<br>
                    Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy<br>
                    New money, suit and tie<br>
                    I can read you like a magazine<br>
                    Ain't it funny? Rumors fly<br>
                    And I know you heard about me<br>
                    So, hey, let's be friends<br>
                    I'm dying to see how this one<br> ends
                    Grab your passport and my hand<br>
                    I can make the bad guys good for weekend<br><br>
                    
                    [Chorus]<br>
                    So it's gonna be forever<br>

                    I get drunk on jealousy<br>
                    But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
